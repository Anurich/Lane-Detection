# Lane-Detection
<p>A lane is part of a roadway (carriageway) that is designated to be used by a single line of vehicles, to control and guide drivers and reduce traffic conflicts.
The task that we wish to perform is that of real-time lane detection in a video. There are multiple ways we can perform lane detection. We can use the learning-based approaches, such as training a deep learning model on an annotated video dataset, or use a pre-trained model. In this project I used the deep learning approach. </p>

  <li> Try to solve lane detection as Regression problem.</li>
  <li> Solve lane detection as Semantic Segmentation problem. </li>
